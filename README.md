# RL Bidding Game - Python Version with Multiple AI Agents

A competitive bidding game where a human player faces off against **5 different AI agents**, each with unique bidding strategies! The goal is to strategically overbid on software products to win points.

**This is the Python Flask implementation with multiple AI opponents, converted from the original JavaScript version.**

## How to Play

### Game Rules
1. **Objective**: Engage in auction-style bidding starting below market value
2. **Bidding Process**:
   - First bid must be BELOW the market value of the item
   - Players take turns bidding higher amounts
   - Each subsequent bid must exceed the previous bid
   - Either player can abandon at any time (after first bid is placed)
3. **Winning Conditions**:
   - Winner is the last player to bid before opponent abandons
   - Winner gets the item at their final bid price
4. **Scoring**: Points = (Market Value - Your Final Bid) Ã— 10 + 50 (minimum 50 points)

### Game Features

#### 5 Different AI Opponents
Choose from 5 AI agents, each with a unique bidding strategy:

1. **Truthful Bidder** - Value-based strategy that bids close to estimated item value
2. **Sniper** - Waits until late in the game then makes aggressive last-moment bids  
3. **Incremental Bidder** - Makes small, gradual step-by-step increases to test opponents
4. **Jump Bidder** - Makes large intimidating jumps to scare off competitors
5. **Shader** - Underbids to maximize profit margin, very conservative approach

#### Adaptive AI Behavior
- Each AI has distinct personality and risk tolerance
- Different abandonment criteria based on strategy
- Unique bidding patterns that you can learn to exploit
- Varying difficulty levels from conservative to aggressive

#### AI Stopping Criteria
The AI uses sophisticated decision-making to determine when to abandon bidding:

1. **Economic Rationality**: Abandons if bids exceed 130% of market value
2. **Market Value Awareness**: Higher abandon probability as bids approach/exceed market value
3. **Risk Assessment**: Analyzes opponent's bidding patterns and aggressiveness
4. **Learning-Based Decisions**: Uses Q-values to compare abandoning vs continuing
5. **Progressive Risk Tolerance**: More likely to abandon as bids approach market value (85%+)
6. **Performance-Based Strategy**: Adjusts conservativeness based on win/loss ratio

*Note: No artificial round limits - bidding continues until economic criteria are met*

#### Game Interface
- **Continuous Bidding**: Enter bids that must exceed the current highest bid
- **Abandon Option**: Strategic decision to quit the bidding war
- **Real-time Competition**: Watch the AI make complex abandon/continue decisions
- **Bidding Sequence Display**: See the complete history of bids in each round
- **Game Statistics**: Track win rates, average bid differences, and performance
- **Persistent Learning**: AI saves and loads its learned knowledge between sessions

## Technical Implementation

### Files Structure
- `app.py`: Flask web application and main game logic
- `rl_agent.py`: Reinforcement learning AI implementation in Python
- `templates/index.html`: Main game interface with JavaScript client
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

### RL Agent Details (Python Implementation)
- **Algorithm**: Q-Learning with experience replay
- **State Space**: Discretized based on price ranges, bid ratios, and game phase
- **Action Space**: 8 different bid ratios relative to actual price (30% to 160%)
- **Reward Function**: Balanced rewards for winning, efficiency, and risk management
- **Learning Rate**: 0.1 with epsilon-greedy exploration (starts at 20%, decays to 5%)
- **Persistence**: Model saves to `rl_bidding_agent.pkl` using Python pickle
- **Web Integration**: RESTful API endpoints for real-time game interaction

### Software Items Database
The game includes 20 different software products across various categories:
- Development tools (Code Editor Pro, Web Framework Suite)
- Security software (Security Scanner, VPN Client)
- Creative tools (Design Studio, Photo Editor Pro)
- AI/ML platforms (AI Development Kit, Machine Learning Platform)
- And more!

Each item has realistic pricing with Â±20% random variation per round.
